# Project Description

It is 2 dimenensional game, with space ship and asteroids, following are details for the game guide.
    Use the arrow keys to move around your ship
    Use spacebar to shoot a projectile (pew pew)
    You have limited ammo
    You get points for dodging or destroying asteroids (kaboom!)
    After navigating several asteroids, you will eventually face an asteroid wall
    Passing this wall moves you onto a new level
    Levels increase difficulty by spawning more asteroids at once
    You also get additional ammo on each level
    Points accumulate faster at higher levels
    Playing difficulty options:
    
    Trainee (Easy)
      20 collisions, 100 ammo, +50 ammo each level, fast fire rate, low velocity asteroids
    Airman (Medium)
      10 collisions, 25 ammo, +25 ammo each level, medium fire rate, medium velocity asteroids
    Ace (Hard)
      4 collisions, 10 ammo, + 10 ammo each level, slow fire rate, high velocity asteroids
